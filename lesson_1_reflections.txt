Windows Command: FC old_file new_file

Mac & Linux Command: diff -u old_file new_file

Useful commands:
git log                          #Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.

git log --stat                   #Shows all file changes

git diff old_commit new_commit   #Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.

git clone repository_url         #Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.

git checkout commitid_to_restore #Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.


************************REFLECTIONS********************************

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It is an easy and fast way to pinpoint the exact changes that occured and find the error or typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	
	You can always go back to previous versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros:
	- Can save when finishing a specific task
	Cons:
	- Can automatically save in the middle of performing a task and not quite finishing it yet
	- Can forget to save after too long of a time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	The files can be related and interchangeable within each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	This is self explanatory

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	You are always safe because you can always go back to previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Sharing and creating code with others.
